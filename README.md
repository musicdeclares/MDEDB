## User Contract

```gherkin
Feature: Curate and route artists to vetted climate organizations

   Scenario: Organizer curates actionable partners for artists
      Given I am an MDE Organizer
      And I need a database of grassroots climate organizations with actionable CTAs
      When I search and filter by geography, issue focus, and impact signals
      Then I can select approved, verified organizations to route artists appropriately
      And artists only see organizations that are approved and verified
```

### Primary Acceptance Criteria

- ✅ Search organizations by location (country/region)
- ✅ Retrieve organizations with verified contact info and links
- ✅ Filter by organizational impact metrics and issue focus
- ✅ Restrict artist visibility to approved, verified organizations only
- ✅ Admin users can assess, comment, and approve/reject submissions
- ✅ Data integrity: unverified organizations invisible to public queries

---

## Enforcement Model

This contract is enforced at multiple layers:

### **Data Layer** - [app/models/](app/models/)
- Organization interface defines required fields: `name`, `contact`, `website`, `country`, `impact_focus`
- Score aggregation ensures minimum quality thresholds before visibility gates

### **Permission Layer** - [app/utils/supabase/middleware.ts](app/utils/supabase/middleware.ts)
- JWT token validation guards `/admin` from unauthenticated access
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies enforce role-based data visibility

### **Visibility Layer** - [app/admin/page.tsx](app/admin/page.tsx#L1)
- `status` field gates organization visibility: `approved | rejected | pending`
- Artist-facing queries filter: `WHERE status = 'approved' AND verified_at IS NOT NULL`
- Admin view shows all statuses for decision-making

### **Verification Pipeline** - [app/api/metadata/route.ts](app/api/metadata/route.ts)
- Website metadata fetching validates domain ownership and legitimacy
- Favicon extraction and HTTP status checking prevents dead links from appearing
- Failed metadata marks organization as requiring manual review

### **Assessment Layer** - [app/components/ScoringSection/index.tsx](app/components/ScoringSection/index.tsx)
- 13-criteria rubric enforces structured evaluation before approval
- Minimum score threshold prevents low-quality orgs from approval
- Comments required for rejection justify blocking decisions

---

---

## Out of Scope

The following are explicitly NOT solved by this project:

- **Organization self-submission** - All organization submissions are manually reviewed and added by admins. Public users cannot submit directly. Ensures verification discipline for each entry.
- **Automated organization vetting** - Assessment requires human judgment. AI scoring rejected as insufficient for trust decisions.
- **Real-time campaign analytics** - System tracks what artists choose; impact measurement outside scope.
- **Multi-language support** - Currently English-only. Localization deferred pending user research.
- **Bulk data import** - CSV/JSON import deliberately excluded. Maintains verification discipline for each entry.

---

## Architecture Decisions

### **Problem: Real-time data integrity vs. simplicity**
- **Option A** - Event-driven architecture with message queue (Kafka, Bull)
- **Option B** - Supabase real-time subscriptions with RLS policies (chosen)
- **Why B:** Stateless, built-in, enforces security at DB layer. Message queue adds operational complexity without solving the core problem at this scale.

### **Problem: Auth strategy for small team**
- **Option A** - Custom JWT + session server
- **Option B** - Firebase Auth
- **Option C** - Supabase Auth with @supabase/ssr (chosen)
- **Why C:** PostgreSQL-native, SSR-friendly, RLS integrates seamlessly. Firebase would force NoSQL semantics incompatible with relational verification model.

### **Problem: Metadata freshness without polling**
- **Option A** - Scheduled cron job (systemd, external service)
- **Option B** - On-demand fetch with client-side cache
- **Option C** - Supabase Edge Function on insert/update (chosen)
- **Why C:** No separate infrastructure, triggered by actual changes, minimal latency. Cron jobs are harder to test and reason about.

### **Problem: Styling consistency at scale**
- **Option A** - CSS-in-JS (Styled Components, Emotion)
- **Option B** - Vanilla CSS with design tokens
- **Option C** - Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables (chosen)
- **Why C:** Utility-first scales with team size. CSS-in-JS adds bundle weight. Tailwind + variables balances composition and DRY.

### **What Would Change at Scale**
- If orgs > 10k: Add Algolia or Elasticsearch for search (Postgres full-text may lag)
- If admins > 20: Add audit logging + approval workflows
- If open-sourced: API layer + webhook system for integrations

---

## Known Constraints

### **Case: Dead Link Protection**

**Flow:**
1. Admin adds organization with website link
2. Metadata API attempts fetch with 24-hour caching
3. If fetch fails (404, timeout, unreachable), fallback placeholder generated with domain-based favicon
4. Organization appears in admin view regardless of metadata fetch success
5. Public view filters by `approval_status = 'approved'` only
6. Metadata enrichment (favicons, descriptions) improves UX but doesn't gate visibility

**Trade-off:** Metadata failures don't block workflow. Admins can approve organizations even if website is temporarily unreachable. Artists may encounter broken links if sites go down after approval.

### **Case: Email Validation**

**Technical protection:**
- Client-side validation: [app/utils/validation.ts](app/utils/validation.ts)
- Regex: `/^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/`
- Supports multiple emails (comma/semicolon separated)
- Warnings if > 5 emails

**User experience:**
- Form shows red border: "Invalid email format: user@example"
- Invalid email prevents form submission
- Email field optional (can be added later)

**Gap:** No database-level constraint. Relies entirely on form validation. Malicious/buggy clients could bypass.

### **Case: Scoring Overwrite Risk**

**Current behavior:**
- Dropdown scoring interface with 0-2 scale
- Comments field limited to 1000 characters
- Save button commits all scores atomically
- No confirmation prompt when overwriting existing scores

**Gap:** No edit history, timestamps, or admin attribution. Accidental overwrites are silent and unrecoverable. Mentioned as scaling concern in Architecture Decisions but not yet prioritized.

---

## Tech Stack Justifications

**JWT Auth over sessions:**  
Stateless. Supports distributed clients without server session storage.

**Row Level Security over API-layer authorization:**  
Enforced at database, so bugs in API logic can't leak data. Single source of truth.

**Supabase over custom backend:**  
PostgreSQL semantics with instant scaling. Trade: vendor lock-in, but speed of iteration outweighs at team size of 1.

**Tailwind CSS over BEM + vanilla CSS:**  
Scales faster with small team. Maintenance burden lower. CSS variables bridge customization gaps.

**Next.js App Router over Pages Router:**  
Server components reduce client-side state. Middleware runs early in request cycle. Server-side auth cleaner.

## Scoring System

### **13-Criteria Assessment Framework**

Organizations are evaluated across 13 key criteria, each scored 0-2:

1. **Impact Track Record** - Demonstrated environmental impact
2. **Local Legitimacy** - Community recognition and trust
3. **Transparency** - Open communication and accountability
4. **Scalability** - Potential for growth and replication
5. **Digital Presence** - Online visibility and engagement
6. **Alignment** - Mission alignment with climate goals
7. **Urgency Relevance** - Addressing critical climate issues
8. **Clear Actionable CTA** - Specific action opportunities
9. **Show Ready CTA** - Event-ready engagement options
10. **Scalable Impact** - Potential for widespread influence
11. **Accessibility** - Inclusive participation opportunities
12. **Global/Regional Fit** - Geographic relevance
13. **Volunteer Pipeline** - Volunteer recruitment and management

### **Scoring Guidelines**
- **0 Points** - Does not meet the criteria
- **1 Point** - Unclear or questionable
- **2 Points** - Clearly meets the criteria

### **Recommendations**
- **21-26 Points** - Strong Candidate (Recommended for approval)
- **13-20 Points** - Promising, Needs Follow-Up
- **0-12 Points** - Low Priority / Not Suitable

---

## Deployment

### Deploying to Cloudflare Workers

Hosted on **Cloudflare Workers** via [OpenNext](https://opennext.js.org/cloudflare), in the Music Declares Emergency Cloudflare account. There is a single production Worker, `orgdb`, at `orgdb.musicdeclares.net`.

**CI/CD** (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`): pushing to `main` deploys production automatically. You can also redeploy `main` manually from the Actions tab ("Run workflow").

**Configuration** lives in the `production` GitHub Environment (Settings, then Environments):

- **Secret**: `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` (org-level; a token with Workers Scripts, Edit, on the MDE account)
- **Variables**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` (the production Supabase project)

These variables are public (inlined into the client bundle). MDEDB has no server-side secret; all access uses the publishable key and Row Level Security. The Worker's URL must be in the Supabase project's Auth redirect allow-list.

**Local commands:**

```bash
npm run dev       # Next.js dev server (localhost:3000)
npm run preview   # build and serve on the workerd runtime (localhost:8787)
```

Point `.env` at a **non-production** Supabase (your own dev project, per the Installation steps) so local work never touches production. Next.js loads `.env` at build time to inline the `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` values. Because `.env` holds non-production values, deploy through CI rather than from your machine: running `npm run deploy` locally would inline your `.env` values into the **production** Worker. CI injects the production Environment's variables.

> **Note:**  
> Make sure your Supabase database and authentication are fully configured before deploying.

---

### Troubleshooting

#### CSS Linting Warnings

You may see warnings like `Can't validate with unknown variable '--font-ibm-plex'` from the CSS linter.  
These are safe to ignore as long as your custom properties are defined in your CSS (e.g., in `:root`).  
The app uses proper fallback font stacks for all custom font variables.
